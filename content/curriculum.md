# Work Experience
---
### Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer - Intelygenz (Madrid)
April 2018 - Present 

 - Develop and implement a working methodology for the entire data team that follows the scientific method. This methodology significantly reduced the work required to implement ML models in production. Two tools were created from this work. [[Science Toolkit]](https://github.com/konstellation-io/science-toolkit) [[KRE]](https://github.com/konstellation-io/kre)
 - Design, develop, deploy and monitor machine learning and deep learning models/infrastructure into production environments embracing MLOps philosophy. Time series forecast, NLP, computer vision and recommendation systems.
 - Guide stakeholders to find better business opportunities based on analyzed data that bring new value to the company.

### Machine Learning Researcher - Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (Madrid)
January 2017 - March 2018 (1 year, 3 months)

 - Research and develop new machine learning models that fits into emerging 5G networks problems at [European-founded project H2020 CogNet](https://5g-ppp.eu/cognet/). Cloud anomaly detection and network traffic pattern recognition.

### Software Developer Intern - Ericsson (Madrid)
February 2015 - August 2015 (7 months)

 - Develop an internal tool to simulate network architectures in virtual machines using C/C++ and Bash.

# Education/Academia

### Statistics
2020 - Masters's Degree - Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (Spain)

The master offered two main pathways: methodological and applied. The first one places more emphasis in advanced statistical methods for data science, while the latter was more interested in applications, consulting, and high-performance computing. [[Complete Curriculum]](https://www.uc3m.es/master/statistics-data-science)

Each pathway is associated with a series of optional subjects among nine electivel subjects:

 - Methodological: Simulation and Resampling, Time Series Analysis; Advanced Regression and Prediction, Biostatistics; Functional Data Analysis.
 - Applied: Data Tidying and Reporting; Network Analysis, Graphical and Hidden Markov Models; Advanced Numerical Methods for Data Science. 

An incomplete set of lecture notes on my own can be found [here](https://github.com/RicardoHS/statistics-for-data-science-book) [[Direct link to PDF]](https://github.com/RicardoHS/statistics-for-data-science-book/blob/master/src/main.pdf)

The **master thesis** consisted on a methological review/improvement of the current academic status on malnutrition detection on children using arm circunference measurements. The work improve the current state-of-the-art classification levels between 3% and 10% in some cases. This improvement was accomplished by using novel machine learning models and proposing new analytical methods.

### Software Engineering
2017 - Bacheelor's Degree - Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (Spain)

Computer science foundations, electrical physics, programming, algorithms, computational complexity, data bases, data structures, software design, software requirements engineering, networks, operating systems foundations, programing languages foundations, basic statistics, algebra and more. [[Complete Curriculum]](https://www.etsisi.upm.es/estudios/grados/61iw/ig)

Final thesis consisted on the analysis and develop of a new text compressing algorithm based on fibonacci and lucas secuence generalization, namely zeckendorf generalization. Based on this generalization, a new set of universal codes was proposed, named zeckendorf codes.

### Computer Science
2017 - Erasmus Internship - Politechnika Poznańska (Poland)

Spent 6 months reviewing computer science stuff, making new friends, learning a new culture and eating a lot of zurek. 10 out of 10, would repeat. [[University WEB]](https://www.put.poznan.pl/)

# Technological Stack
---
I dont really like these kind of sections. The tools I use are constantly changing and learning new stuff is not a problem for me. Nevertheless some people find this list useful.

 - Programming: Python, R, Bash and Javascript on things I use daily. Julia, C/C++, C#, Java, GoLang on things I use sporadically and need to be briefly reviewed before re-use it.
 - Statistics: Data Analysis, Forecasting, Clustering, Dimmension Reduction, Time Series, Machine Learning, Deep Learning.
 - Visualization: matplotlib, ggplot2, seaborn, d3.js
 - Tools/Stack: Sci-kit Learn, Pytorch, Numpy, Pandas, nltk, gensim, huggingface, tidyverse, ORMs, Flask, Django, PostgreSQL, MongoDB (ask me if these kind of stuff is important for you)
 - Software: GNU/Linux, Git, CI/CD, SQL, NoSQL, Web Scraping, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean, Bootstrap, Microservices and growing.
