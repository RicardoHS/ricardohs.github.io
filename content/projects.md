# Personal Projects

Here are some of my tech hobby work. Not all of them but just the ones with enough maturity to be public. Take a look if some of them seems interesting for you. Most of them are proof of concepts or little project to learn something new, [you know](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning-by-doing_(economics)).

Sorted by time (newest first):

 - [WebGPU Mandelbrot Set explorer](https://github.com/RicardoHS/wgpu_mandelbrot): [Live Demo](./content/demos/wgpu_mandelbrot.html) Explore the mandelbrot set in you web browser using your GPU.
 - [Conway's Game of Life using Kernels](https://github.com/RicardoHS/conway_game): Fast computation of cellular automata epochs (and easier code too). The repo also contains a self-made algorithm to find loops in the game.
 - [DeepCoinCounter](https://github.com/RicardoHS/DeepCoinCounter): A small PoC of a mobile app to automatically count cash using the phone camera. The ML models and data augmentation scripts (very useful for this problem by the way) are finished but the implementation as an app using TensorflowLite an Flutter is incomplete.
 - [Procedural Algorithms in Unity](https://github.com/RicardoHS/unity_procedural_caves): My first contact with Unity and procedural algorithms. Nothing novel, just the code of some tutorials in C#.
 - [Binance Arbitrager](https://github.com/RicardoHS/binance-argitrager): Very serious [HFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading) project. Detect and perform intra-market triangular arbitrage in Binance using Julia. The repo contains two algorithms to detect arbitrage and a custom-made binance API (ready to use). The arbitrage is detected in 2-10 nanoseconds but the network latency (2ms using best AWS servers) lacked the whole project and make it unable to make profit in the operations. This project was my first serious contact with Julia.
 - [Master Thesis Project](https://github.com/RicardoHS/geomorph_malnutrition_classification_models): Classification models for landmarks configurations. Geometric morphometrics applied to acute malnutrition diagnosis. More info in the repo.
 - [Bachelor Thesis Project](https://github.com/RicardoHS/zeckendorf-codes): File compressor using self-made algorithm based on Zeckendorf codes. More info in repo.
 - [Little Python Game](https://github.com/RicardoHS/pythonTaraGame): Little project done in my erasmus internship. Nothing important to relate, just my first serious contact with python and tree pruning algorithms. The code is not even good, but I have a fondness for it.
