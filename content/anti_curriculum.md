# Anti-Resume

I saw [this](https://x.com/BonesaiDev/status/1815795402886766742) post on X and not only I though it was cool, but also it could be useful for the appropiate people. So:

 - I dont like when a language is used to solve everything. Despite I have been programming in python for the last 10 years I'm starting to vilipendiate it. Not only its management ecosystem is embarrassingly bad and suboptimal, which it is, but senior people don't seem to care and junior people don't even understand how bad it is. Even worse, because these languages are so popular they are usually treated like silver-bullets and programmers are forced to use them, pushing them into places where they seem to unlearn rather than become more experts on computation.
 - Each language fits on a set of specific problems. Current languages are not used propertly. Most of the problems companies face today should be solved with C, Rust and Go. They would reduce not only their development costs in time but also their infrastructure costs.
 - Web development is not an actual problem, because it was already solved years ago. HTML+CSS+Javascript is all you need. Anything extra is unnecesary complexity.
 - I aim for just writing the code that solves the problem, with the least amount of possible lines and using the computer resources in the best possible way.
 - I love plain simplicity in the code. The over-engineered code architecture is wrong. A beginer that do not know OOP has higher probabilities on writting maintenable code than most ¨seniors¨. If the code structure is not a problem, do not solve it prematurely.
 - I run away from the people that seeks ¨beauty¨ in their code. They are bad coders, 100% sure on this.
 - People do not know how to test software. They write no tests at all or they write a lot of redudant/useless tests.
 - People put a lot of efford thinking on algorithms. I put that efford thinking on data structures and how they are accessed by the micro.
 - My believe is if you spend a lot of time discussing between two solutions it's because both of them are similar enought to be valid. So dont waste that time.
 - Frameworks and libraries should be used when no other alternative exists. Using third party code, even if its open-source, increases your costs on the long run.
 - I aim for writing plain simple code.
 - Current software, on all levels, is extremetly bad. We are living on the past 20 years hardware advances.
 - Javascript is not that slow, it's just you are using it wrongly.
 - The best complexity KPI for a repository is the #lines_of_code. Static code analysis sucks.
 - Commits should serve to follow your dev process, not to store your work. [This is one of the best blog articles of all time.](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)
